      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This document outlines the framework for establishing and maturing the Internal Audit Investigations Program. While operating as an integral part of Uber's broader corporate investigations framework, this program also adheres strictly to IIA standards of conduct, reflecting its unique position within the Internal Audit team.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">A key focus of this program is to evolve from a primarily reactive stance to a more balanced and proactive approach to identifying and addressing misconduct. This involves enhancing our case intake mechanisms through improved collaboration with key internal stakeholders and expanding automated monitoring systems. Furthermore, we aim to establish a robust and systematic process for collecting, analysing, and acting upon identified root causes and issues, ensuring effective and consistent remediation.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Leveraging emerging technologies, particularly AI, is central to these improvements. AI tools are being explored for tasks such as automated contract review and comprehensive report reading, promising to significantly enhance our investigative capabilities and efficiency.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Internal Audit Investigations Program is essential for safeguarding company assets, fostering a strong culture of integrity, and reinforcing confidence across the organisation.</p>

          The Internal Audit investigations program is dual-governed. It is part of Uber’s wider corporate investigations program; but so long as it sits within the Internal Audit team, it is a function carried out by Internal Audit and therefore subject to IIA standards of conduct.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="subsection-title">Key requirements of Uber’s investigations program are:</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
                <li>General conduct: Investigations are conducted in a fair and neutral manner</li>
                <li>Planning: Investigations are adequately scoped and planned</li>
                <li>Findings: Investigation findings must be based on information that is relevant, reliable, and reasonably sufficient to support the conclusions and/or recommendations</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4 class="subsection-title">Key features of the IIA standards that apply to investigations are:</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
                <li>Ethics and professionalism: Internal auditors must demonstrate integrity, maintain objectivity, demonstrate competency, exercise due professional case, and maintain confidentiality</li>
                <li>Planning: A properly resourced and positioned internal audit function develops and implements a strategy to support the organisation’s success</li>
                <li>Performance: Performing internal audit services requires internal auditors to effectively plan engagements, conduct the engagement work to develop findings and conclusions, and collaborate with management to identify recommendations and/or action plans that address the findings</li>
                <li>Root cause analysis: When evaluating potential engagement findings, internal auditors must collaborate with management to identify the root causes where possible</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p class="font-medium text-gray-800">Though part of the Finance org and with no direct management line through the Chief Ethics, Compliance and Security Officer who owns the overall investigations program, the Internal Audit investigations program must ensure conformance with both sets of standards, and close collaboration with counterpart personnel across the investigations portfolio, as well as within Internal Audit.</p>

          Investigation standards for the overall Uber investigations program are laid out in the Internal Investigations Protocol (“the Protocol”), which resides in the library of Uber’s case management system I-Sight.

          Investigation standards for the Internal Audit investigations program, as well as being subject to the Protocol, are laid out in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ofr6LA6n1QhkkQIzUxkQ2YzQjDmcu2JsJNruFdslrME/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Internal Audit Investigations Playbook</a> (“the Playbook”)

          <div class="key-takeaway">
            <span class="font-bold">Key Takeaway</span>
            <br>
            To enhance proactive detection, the program needs improved collaboration with key internal teams and an expansion of automated transaction monitoring systems.
          </div>
          <br>
          <span class="underline">Present state</span>
          <br>
          The Internal Audit Investigations program is currently largely reactive, and (with some exceptions) dependent upon integrity hotline reports.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="underline">Desired future state</span>
          <br>
          It is intended to develop the program towards a more balanced proactive / reactive footing.
          <br>
          According to the ACFE Report To The Nations 2024, while tips are the leading single cause of organisational fraud discovery, they are responsible for fewer than half of all detections overall. Other high-impact detection methods are internal audit, management review, document examination, account reconciliation, and by accident.
          <br>
          <br>
          In some recent cases, other teams (including Strategic Sourcing and Strategic Finance) have developed concerns about potential fraud matters, but have not consulted investigations personnel (or have consulted investigations team months after the fact). Ongoing collaboration and outreach to stakeholders in key teams, including Strategic Sourcing and Strategic Finance, may improve the pipeline of information and lead to more proactive investigations.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ongoing transaction monitoring in fields such as Travel and Expense and vendor transactions does take place throughout Uber, but Internal Audit has very little visibility over it, and much of it is geared primarily towards budgetary compliance and not necessarily with fraud and misconduct in mind. There may be opportunities to improve, re-focus, and build upon existing monitoring mechanisms to identify investigation opportunities. One example: based on recent cases, use an AI reader across Uber’s vendor contract repository to identify contracts that contain provisions for vendors to hold pots of Uber’s money off-book.
          <br>
          <br>
          Data is available about the quantity and type of ethics hotline reports per country. This data may be leveraged to identify countries where Uber has large numbers of employees, but low engagement with the hotline. These countries may be suitable for further proactive engagement including site visits and discussions with personnel on high-risk teams. Further ways to analyse and leverage investigation data will also be explored with the Ethics and Compliance team.
          <br>
          <br>
          Regional Ethics and Compliance teams go so far as to conduct on-site roadshows to proactively engage with personnel in under-reporting areas. The IA investigations lead will discuss this activity with regional leads, and explore the potential upside of conducting similar activities in parallel.

          Ongoing collaboration with other investigation teams is both a requirement of Uber’s Internal Investigations Protocol, and a matter of general good sense.
          <br>
          <br>
          Meeting cadences specifically stipulated in the Protocol, to be attended by Alex, include
          <br>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-800">
              <li>Bi-weekly Investigative Leads meetings (30 minutes, every 2 weeks)</li>
              <li>Regional leads meetings (1 hour, every quarter, x4 for the four mega-regions)</li>
              <li>Financial Risk Management meetings (1 hour, every quarter)</li>
              <li>Other meetings on an as-needed basis, particularly when Internal Audit jointly investigates cases with other teams</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          This amounts to a minimum of 8 hours of meetings per quarter, plus the same again to account for preparation and recording time.
          <br>
          <br>
          Key stakeholders to be prioritised for ongoing collaboration efforts at this stage are Kevin White (the overall owner of the investigation program), and Kelly Schulz (the lead for Ethics and Compliance investigations and a key component of the program overall).
          <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, recent cases have indicated a disconnect between Internal Audit and some other investigative teams, particularly ER and HR; and a lack of mutual visibility and understanding of differing investigative scopes and timelines. Better collaboration and clearer expectation-setting is a priority going forward.

          Although conducting root cause analysis, and remediating identified issues, are expectations across Uber’s investigation teams, in practice these activities are inconsistently and haphazardly carried out.
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class="underline">Desired future state</span>
          <br>
          The Internal Audit investigations lead is uniquely positioned to take on a pivotal role in the analysis and remediation of identified issues. Identifying those issues, achieving buy-in from responsible stakeholders, developing action plans, assigning owners, and tracking progress against set milestones are all well within ordinary Internal Audit activities. Those activities, and the processes and mechanisms that underpin them, require very little tweaking to be put to investigative use.
          <br>
          <br>
          The missing link in the process as it exists today is a systematic way of gathering the right data from investigations, extracting root causes, and collating and prioritising remediation activity upon which those processes can be brought to bear. It is proposed that the IA investigations lead takes primary responsibility for this part of the process.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a starting point, it is proposed that investigation reports be used as the primary documentary repository of root cause analysis. The extent to which this analysis is properly conducted in cases where it is warranted may be reviewed as this project develops. Whether any coaching or reinforcement in this area is required may be discussed with the leadership of the investigation teams as and when the need arises. Those reports should be read and digested - either by the IA investigations lead or, ideally and if the technology is sufficiently capable and reliable, by AI (or by some combination of the two) - and persistent root causes and opportunities for remediation drawn out. These may be discussed and agreed with other investigation leads on already-existing meeting cadences. Once agreed for action, the IA investigations lead will be responsible for leveraging Internal Audit processes for developing and monitoring action plans, and likewise reporting back to investigations leadership.

      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">The Internal Audit Investigations Program is committed to leveraging AI to significantly enhance its capabilities and efficiency. AI is envisioned to play a pivotal role in transforming both proactive detection and systematic remediation processes.</p>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">

        <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-xl p-4 shadow">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-center mb-3">Automated Contract Review</h3>
          AI readers will be explored to analyse Uber’s vendor contract repository. This will help identify contracts containing provisions for vendors to hold Uber’s money off-book, enabling more proactive fraud detection.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-xl p-4 shadow">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-center mb-3">Enhanced Report Reading and Analysis</h3>
          AI tools are being considered to read and digest investigation reports. This will facilitate the extraction of persistent root causes and opportunities for remediation, streamlining the process of collating and prioritising remediation activities.
        </div>

        <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-xl p-4 shadow">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-center mb-3">Data-Driven Proactive Engagement</h3>
          AI can assist in analysing ethics hotline report data to identify trends and under-reporting areas. This data will inform targeted proactive engagement, such as on-site roadshows and discussions with high-risk personnel in specific countries.
