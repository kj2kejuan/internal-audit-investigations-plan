      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This document outlines the framework for establishing and maturing the Internal Audit Investigations Program. While operating as an integral part of Uber's broader corporate investigations framework, this program also adheres strictly to IIA standards of conduct, reflecting its unique position within the Internal Audit team.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">A key focus of this program is to evolve from a primarily reactive stance to a more balanced and proactive approach to identifying and addressing misconduct. This involves enhancing our case intake mechanisms through improved collaboration with key internal stakeholders and expanding automated monitoring systems. Furthermore, we aim to establish a robust and systematic process for collecting, analysing, and acting upon identified root causes and issues, ensuring effective and consistent remediation.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Leveraging emerging technologies, particularly AI, is central to these improvements. AI tools are being explored for tasks such as automated contract review and comprehensive report reading, promising to significantly enhance our investigative capabilities and efficiency.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Internal Audit Investigations Program is essential for safeguarding company assets, fostering a strong culture of integrity, and reinforcing confidence across the organisation.</p>

        <p>The Internal Audit investigations program is dual-governed. It is part of Uberâ€™s wider corporate investigations program; but so long as it sits within the Internal Audit team, it is a function carried out by Internal Audit and therefore subject to IIA standards of conduct.</p>
